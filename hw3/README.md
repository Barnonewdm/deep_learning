# 10-807 Deep Learning Homework 3

##### YJ Choe (yojoongc@andrew.cmu.edu)

* `code` directory includes the package `NN`, which includes implementations of 
    * Deep Boltzmann machines (`code/dbm.py`, new in homework 3), 
    * restricted Boltzmann machines (`code/rbm.py`), 
    * autoencoders and denoising autoencoders (`code/autoencoder.py` and modifications in `code/nn/layer.py`) from homework 2, and 
    * base neural network implementation from homework 1 (`code/nn/`). 

* Analysis and running code of DBMs and autoencoders can be found in the `notebooks` directory. 
    * `notebooks/dbm_mnist.ipynb` contains answers to all DBM-related problems.
