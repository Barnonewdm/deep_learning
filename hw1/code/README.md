This directory contains two directories: `backprop` and `notebooks`. 

All core classes and methods can be found within `backprop`. 

To access the answers to the homework problems, please open the two IPython 
notebooks, `nn_mnist.ipynb` (parts a-g) and `nn_mnist_multilayer.ipynb` 
(part h).

Thanks,
YJ
