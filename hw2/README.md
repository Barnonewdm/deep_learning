* `code` directory includes the package `NN`, which includes implementations of 
    * RBMs (`code/rbm.py`), 
    * autoencoders and denoising autoencoders (`code/autoencoder.py` and modifications in `code/nn/layer.py`), and 
    * base neural network implementation from homework 1 (`code/nn/`). 

* Analysis and running code of RBMs and autoencoders can be found in the `notebooks` directory. 
    * `notebooks/rbm_mnist.ipynb` contains answers to all RBM-related problems.
    * `notebooks/autoencoder_mnist.ipynb` contains answers to all autoencoder- and denoising autoencoder-related problems, as well as comparisons between RBMs and AE/DAEs.
